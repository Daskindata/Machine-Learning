# Machine-Learning
Using the AFSA data file (non-compliance-in-personal-insolvencies.csv: 357,000 rows,
90MB):
1. Prepare data appropriate for the proposed supervised machine learning methodologies; including:
a. Apply and Discuss any appropriate cleaning
b. Apply and Discuss any appropriate data sub-setting
c. Discuss any limitations restrictions of the data
2. Apply one supervised machine learning (ML) method other than ANN or a NN, to the data from
step 1.
a. Investigate the selection of the hyper-parameter(s); if any
b. Report the performance(s) and interpretations(s) of the produced ML model(s)
c. Discuss potential improvements to the final ML model
3. Investigate the application of neural networks (NN) to the data from step 1.
a. Vary the number of hidden layers from 0 to 2
b. For a neural network 3a, investigate varying the number of neurons in the layers
c. Using a neural network from 3a or 3b, explore the effect of different activation
function(s)
d. Report the performance(s) and interpretation(s) of the produced NN models
e. Discuss potential improvements to the final NN model
4
4. Compare and Contrast the chosen ML model (from 2) and a NN model (from 3). At a minimum,
include:
a. Cross-validated accuracy
b. Run time to train models
c. Interpretability
d. Variations/similarities of model insights to for improving the AFSA objective of
identifying risk of non-compliance
